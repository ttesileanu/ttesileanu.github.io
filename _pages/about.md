I am a theoretical physicist turned neuroscientist, turning software engineer. Given my background, my approach to neuroscience has been based on overarching principles and precise, quantitative modelingâ€”typically analytical results followed by numerical simulations.

My neuroscience work was focused on normative modeling of brain circuits, where some optimality criterion based on biologically relevant tasks was used to predict neural-circuit architectures, in particular those that use biologically plausible learning rules.

In what now seems like a different life, I worked in theoretical high-energy physics, focusing on various aspects of the AdS/CFT duality in string theory.

I am now starting a job as a Research Software Engineer in the CTRL team at [Meta](https://www.meta.com).
