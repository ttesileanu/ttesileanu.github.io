I am a theoretical physicist turned neuroscientist, with a strong interest in software development. As a result of this, my approach to neuroscience is based on overarching principles and precise, quantitative modeling â€“ typically analytical results followed by numerical simulations.

My interests lie in normative modeling of brain circuits, where some optimality criterion based on biologically relevant tasks is used to predict neural-circuit architectures, in particular those that use biologically plausible learning rules.

In what now seems like a different life, I worked in theoretical high-energy physics, focusing on various aspects of the AdS/CFT duality in string theory.

I am currently an Associate Research Scientist at the [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience) within the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron).
