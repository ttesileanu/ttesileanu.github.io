My interests lie in normative modeling of brain circuits, where some optimality criterion based on biologically relevant tasks is used to predict neural-circuit architectures, in particular those that use biologically plausible learning rules.

A theoretical physicst by training, I approach neuroscience questions with an emphasis on overarching principles and precise, quantitative modeling. In what now seems like a different life, I worked in theoretical high-energy physics, focusing on various aspects of the AdS/CFT duality in string theory.
