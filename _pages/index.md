I'm an Associated Research Scientist at the [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience) within the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron). I work on building biologically plausible versions of statistical algorithms, with an emphasis on temporal correlations.
